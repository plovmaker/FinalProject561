# FinalProject561
This is a final project for 561

This website works as a platform where artworks can be sold for reasonable price (very reasonable). It has a search feature, you can add, delete and edit art works postings. 

In the process I had problems with figuring what kind of project I want to do. When I decided on what kinda of projects I need to do, I realized I have no time to complete it and with heavy heart I did whatever I could have finished in the short ammount of time that I left myself for this project. 

I don't know why, but my button to go to the home page and see the list of the arts was not working, so I needed to put /arts after the address to get to it. Search by the name of the Art worked, however the ganre didn't work for painting. I assume its because my website advanced AI doesn't recognize painting as an form of art. 

I was trying to have a possibility to download files to the website, but the page would give me exception that there is no such name for the page, when I pressed on it. So I deleted the page completly. 

My biggest challenge is not to give up and go back to Mother Russia, where my home boy Vladimir is building dictatorship just like granpa Stalin wished! Miss my bear Dmitriy and his lovely balalaika sounds in the morning. 

Jokes aside I know this website is not very outstanding project, however I tried and spend around 30 hours working on it and I hope I would not need to take this class again, however I enjoy being in your classes. I wish you great summer, please pass me!
